**Taking a data-driven approach to Earlham College recruitment.**

The point of this program was to better guide the decision making process of program and scholarship creation in the Earlham College Admissions Department.

We were given "historical applicant data" from the years 2018-21 of students who had been admitted to Earlham College.  Each year was its own seperate Excel file - so we had four Excel files to work with.  Each file contained somewhere between 900-1500 rows of data (each row being an admitted student).  Each row had 56 columns.  Columns 1-15 contained personal information, and columns 16-56 contained information that the students had written on their application concerning the types of clubs and activities they took part in during high school.

This clubs and activities information was completely student inputted, so the data was very sloppy and inconsistent.  Since it wasn't a pre-determined field in our application (with boxes to check, etc.) it was hard for our team to find ways to organize the data and really study it.  *I have attached one of these Excel sheets ('Applicants with Interests 2019') with all of the personal information removed, so that it can be better visualized what kind of data we were working with.*

*What this program did was find a way to effectively sort through this unorganized data and allow us to better understand what clubs and activities Earlham College applicants take part in during their high school careers.*

The final result of this program ('Total Clubs 2018-2021') provides us a simple and user-friendly way to understand this data.  It has allowed us to make decisions on programming and scholarship creation using real-data that we otherwise may not have been able to.

Using this code, I am also able to run queries for my colleagues on our current admitted students.  **For example: if a colleague wants a list of all of the students from California, Washington or Oregon who are involved in either Student Government or Student Council, I can quickly get them an Excel file with that information.**  This provides a really easy way for us to send very targeted and tailored messages to students.  More efficient communication is better for all parties involved in the college search process.

I added 'Query Example.ipynb' to show this process.  I hid the DataFrame as to not show the names and information of our students.

Thank you for reading.
